THIS IS A SIMPLE WEATHER PROJECT WHICH GIVES CURRENT TEMPERATURE and DESCRIPTION OF AN AREA WHILE INPUTTING ITS LATTITUDES AND LONGITUDES

Using it on your machine is very simple:

1) Git Clone on your machine.
2) Open `base.html` in the root directory.
3) Enjoy

This project uses HTML, CSS & JQuery. 

The api I used is : ` https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/api/current?lat=${lat}&lon=${long} `

where {lat} and {long} represents the lattitude and longitude of the place you want to access. 
It takes the data from nearest weather station therefore sometimes main city names will not be visible

Screenshots of the project could be seen from : `/ss` subfolder.
